Do you find it hard to save money for your personal goals? What if we told you that every small purchase you make could automatically contribute to your dream vacation, emergency fund, or a new gadget—without you even noticing?

Welcome to the Round-Up Rule.

### What is Round-Up Saving?
Round-up saving is a smart and automatic way to build your savings. Every time you spend money, your transaction is rounded up to the nearest ₹10, ₹50, or ₹100, and the spare change is moved into a savings goal of your choice.

**Example:**

You spend ₹417 on groceries

You choose to round up to the nearest ₹50

₹33 (₹450 - ₹417) is automatically saved toward your “New Phone” goal

### How It Works:

1. Set your round-up threshold (₹10, ₹50, or ₹100)
2. Choose a savings goal (Emergency fund, Vacation, Wedding, etc.)
3. Spend as usual — the app automatically saves the difference
4. Watch your goals grow with each transaction

### Why This Method Works So Well:
✅ Effortless: No need to plan your savings—just spend and save passively  
✅ Psychologically rewarding: You’ll feel great seeing your goals grow  
✅ Builds a habit: Saving becomes a natural part of your daily life  
✅ Compounds over time: Small amounts grow into big funds over months

### Real-Life Impact:

10 transactions a week rounding up ₹30 = ₹1,200/month

In a year, that’s ₹14,400 saved without trying

### Top Goal Ideas to Try:

- Emergency Fund
- Travel Bucket List
- Health Insurance Top-Up
- New Laptop
- Festive Gifting Fund

### Final Thoughts:
With the round-up method, every transaction is a step toward a goal. You don’t need to earn more—you just need to save smarter.

Start rounding up today. Your future self will thank you.
